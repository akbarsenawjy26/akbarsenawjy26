# About Me
Hello, I am an IoT Engineer with a passion for developing firmware for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly based on microcontroller platforms. Over the past three years, I have focused on creating firmware for remote monitoring systems across a variety of projects. Currently, I work as an IoT Engineer at a leading national IT consulting firm.

I specialize in leveraging modern technologies to design and implement efficient, scalable solutions for IoT systems. In one of my recent projects, I built a RESTful API and Dashboard using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), integrating it with ESP32 hardware, which was programmed using the Arduino Framework and PlatformIO. The communication between devices is handled via the MQTT protocol, while data is stored and managed in InfluxDB and PostgreSQL databases.

# My Work Experience Timeline Summary
- **2022**
  - Developed firmware for a push-up counter device with 1 Master and 5 slave nodes using ESPNOW protocol.
- **2023**
  - Monitored and implemented Voltage Unbalance protection for a 3-phase Laser machine using Modbus for data acquisition.
  - Implemented logging of electrical and physical parameters for 2 units of 150kVA transformers. This included logging electrical parameters on the LV side and Oil Temperature (OTI) for physical parameters.

# My Skill Set
- **Firmware Framework**: Majority of my projects are developed using the Arduino with PlatformIO.
- **Firmware Architecture Design**: Implementation of OOP principles in firmware architecture to facilitate development and scalability.
- **Programming Language**: I use Arduino with PlatformIO for firmware, JavaScript with NodeJS-Express Framework or Golang with Echo Framework for Backend, and React JS for Front-End.
