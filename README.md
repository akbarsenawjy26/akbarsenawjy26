# Hello!

## About Me
Hello, I am a junior Firmware Engineer with a passion for developing Internet of Things (IoT) device firmware based on microcontrollers. Over the past 2 years, I have been focused on writing firmware for remote monitoring systems across various projects. Currently, I work as an R&D Electrical Engineer at a national Transformer company.

## My Work Experience Timeline Summary
- **2022**
  - Developed firmware for a push-up counter device with 1 Master and 5 slave nodes using ESPNOW protocol.
- **2023**
  - Monitored and implemented Voltage Unbalance protection for a 3-phase Laser machine using Modbus for data acquisition.
  - Implemented logging of electrical and physical parameters for 2 units of 150kVA transformers. This included logging electrical parameters on the LV side and Oil Temperature (OTI) for physical parameters.

## My Skill Set
- **Firmware Framework**: Majority of my projects are developed using the Arduino framework.
- **Firmware Architecture Design**: Implementation of OOP principles in firmware architecture to facilitate development and scalability.
- **Programming Language**: I use C/C++ for firmware, JS/Python for middleware, and rely on ChatGPT for backend and frontend assistance.

## Technical Skills
- **Wired Protocols**:
  - SPI
  - I2C
  - UART/USART
  - Modbus RTU (RS485)
- **Wireless Protocols**:
